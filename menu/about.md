### yurtbase is an blog run by Emre Yurtbay, an incoming research data scientist @ Meta.

I studied statistics, among other things, @ Rice University and am currently in grad school @ Duke University. I'm mostly interested in probability, but I'll also dabble in other silly little math things. Beyond maths, I am interested in literature, languages, and writing.

@ Meta, I worked on Kats, a kit to analyze time series data, a lightweight, easy-to-use, generalizable, and extendable framework to perform time series analysis. Check it out [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Kats)!
