### yurtbase is an blog run by Emre Yurtbay, an incoming research data scientist @ Meta.

I studied statistics, among other things, @ Rice University and am currently at grad school studying "statisitical science", whatever that means, @ Duke University. I'm mostly interested in probability, but I'll also dabble in other silly little math things. Beyond maths, I am interested in literature, languages, and writing.
