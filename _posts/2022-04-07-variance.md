Suppose you are confronted by a bridge troll who won't let you cross unless you can explain why the variance of an arbitrary random variable $X$ is non-negative. How can this be demonstrated in a cute way? 

First, we begin with the definition: $V(X) = E \left[\left(X - E[X]\right)^{2}\right]$. Sure enough, this is all you really need, as $(X - E(X))^2$ is a random variable that always takes non-negative values. The expectation of a non-negative random variable must be non-negative, so $E \left[\left(X - E[X]\right)^{2}\right] \geq 0$ and therefore $V(X) \geq 0$.

Alas, it's a tense situation, so let's suppose you forget this. Instead, you begin expanding $E \left[\left(X - E[X]\right)^{2}\right]$.

$$\begin{aligned} 2x - 4 &= 6 \\ 2x &= 10 \\ x &= 5 \end{aligned}$$
