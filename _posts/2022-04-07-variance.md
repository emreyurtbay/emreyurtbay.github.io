Suppose we are confronted by a bridge troll who won't let us cross unless we can explain why the variance of an arbitrary random variable $X$ is non-negative. How can this be demonstrated in a cute way? 

First, we begin with the definition of variance: $V(X) = E \left[\left(X - E[X]\right)^{2}\right]$. Sure enough, this is all we really need, since $(X - E[X])^2$ is itself a random variable that always takes non-negative values, thanks to the squaring term. The expectation of a non-negative random variable must be non-negative, so $E \left[\left(X - E[X]\right)^{2}\right] \geq 0$ and therefore $V(X) \geq 0$.

Alas, it's a tense and nervy situation, so let's suppose we forget this. Instead, we begin expanding $E \left[\left(X - E[X]\right)^{2}\right]$.

$$\begin{aligned} E \left[\left(X - E[X]\right)^{2}\right] &= E[X^2 - 2XE[X] + E[X]^2] \\ &= E[X^2] - 2E[X]E[X] + E[X]^2 \\ &= E[X^2] - E[X]^2\end{aligned}$$

So $V(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2$. We can prove $V(X) \geq 0$ if we show $E[X^2] \geq E[X]^2$. Luckily, we remember a fun little result called Jensen's inequality, which states that for a convex function $g$: 

$$E[g(X)] \geq g(E[X])$$

Thanks to our friend Jensen, we can conclude $E[X^2] \geq E[X]^2$ if we can show $g(X) = X^2$ is a convex function. This may seem trivial to some, but recall from calculus that for any function that is twice-differentiable on an interval $I$, if $g"(X) > 0$ for each $X \in I$, then $g(X)$ is convex. We know that $g"(X) = 2 \geq 0$ so $g(X) = X^2$ is convex, and $E[X^2] \geq E[X]^2$, so $V(X) \geq 0$.

The troll is satisfied, and we can cross the bridge.
